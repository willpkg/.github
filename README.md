# will

The package manager that willingly installs packages.

**Hello, fellow traveler. This is just a mirror of the main repositories on GitLab [here](https://gitlab.com/willpkg). The repositories there are more up-to-date and all issues and PRs should go to there.**

See [the CLI repo](https://gitlab.com/willpkg/cli) for how a typical install should work.
